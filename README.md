# Credit_Card_Fradud_Detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection Project:
This project tackles the critical issue of credit card fraud using machine learning techniques.

Data:

Dataset size: 1.8 million transactions
Scope: Covers 800 businesses and 1000 customers
Challenges:

Class Imbalance: The dataset presented a significant challenge with only 0.52% of transactions being fraudulent. This imbalance can hinder model performance.
Solutions and Achievements:

Model Development: A machine learning model was developed to effectively detect fraudulent transactions despite the class imbalance.
Fraud Detection Efficiency: The model achieved a remarkable 94.76% improvement in fraud detection and prevention efficiency.
Targeted Strategies: Through extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), key factors influencing user behavior were identified. This valuable insight will inform the development of targeted strategies for further fraud prevention.

Key Skills Demonstrated:

Root Cause Analysis: Identified the root cause of the problem - class imbalance - and its impact on model performance.
Cost Benefit Analysis: Demonstrated the significant financial benefit achieved by the model's improved fraud detection efficiency.
This project showcases successful application of machine learning and data analysis in combating credit card fraud. The results translate to substantial cost savings for businesses and enhanced security for customers.
